                <li>Start by preheating the oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
                <li>The secret to great chicken thighs is to keep it simple. Chicken will taste great with a lot of seasoning or with only a little seasoning. In this recipe we will use less seasoning. With that being said, the next step is to cover the chicken with olive oil and add a little black pepper and salt.</li>
                <li>Once the oven is preheated, add the chicken thighs to the oven. Cooking time is approximately 40-45 minutes, however this varies depending on the amount of chicken being cooked.</li>
                <li>Congratulations! Your chicken is now fully cooked! Enjoy!</li>
